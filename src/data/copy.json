Let me clarify the details and address your concerns regarding the unit of emotional analysis and the constraints of the song corpus."},{"type":"text","value":"Unit of emotional analysis:"},{"type":"text","value":"The primary unit of analysis will be the overall emotional sentiment of each song, determined by analyzing the lyrics in their entirety.

These genres have been consistently popular and influential throughout the chosen timeframe. By comparing emotional trends across genres, we can identify any genre-specific patterns or differences in emotional expression."},{"type":"Popularity","value":"To ensure the songs analyzed are representative of mainstream music consumption, we'll focus on songs that have achieved significant popularity. This can be determined by factors such as chart performance (e.g., Billboard Hot 100), sales figures, and streaming numbers. We can establish a popularity threshold (e.g., songs that reached the top 50 on the charts) to filter the dataset."},{"type":"Language","value":"To maintain consistency in the emotional analysis and interpretation, we'll limit the corpus to songs with English lyrics.

It does the bare minimum, strictly following its prompts, for better or worse (or, “garbage in, garbage out”). The effort it takes us to fix things like this and produce pieces that cover all the bases can often take days on end. It involves questioning results, identifying edge cases, doing more research, and repeating. This stage of our projects is often the most deceptively time-consuming. So while Claude was faster, it is “satisfied” with whatever it generates. Critical thinking still falls to the user.
