How scared should we be that someone else could replicate what we do without the time, training, and expertise we have?"},{"type":"text","value":"Basically, <strong>can AI write a Pudding piece?</strong> (Also, for those less well-versed with AI, what does it actually “do,” and how well does it do it?)"},{"type":"text","value":"So, we tried replacing ourselves! Before we started, we created a set of rules and guidelines for our interactions with the AI:"},{"type":"list","value":["We broke the process of creating a Pudding piece down into four steps, and guided the AI through them. These were: idea generation, data collection & analysis, storyboarding & prototyping, and development & writing.","For each task, we prompted it until it either completed the task or failed repeatedly, at which point, we modified the task to make it surmountable.","Other than guiding it through the process and re-scoping when necessary, we attempted to intervene as little as possible. We tried to mimic how a data-storytelling-inclined layperson would interact with the AI, refraining from using as much of our data visualization or journalism expertise as possible."]},{"type":"text","value":"We started the process in parallel with both ChatGPT (4) and Claude (3 Opus), but we were more satisfied with Claude’s work. So, partway through, we decided to focus solely on that."},{"type":"heading","value":"Part 0: Setting the stage"},{"type":"text","value":"Before we started on the story, we introduced ourselves and gave Claude some background reading on The Pudding’s process."},{"type":"chat","description":"chats of our initial prompt, a small sampling of the readings","prompt":[{"type":"text","value":"We want you to be a freelance contributor for The Pudding.

For Claude, that meant scraping lyrics from Billboard top 100 hits from Genius.com. We asked it to write Python scripts which we ran for it (since it’s not able to run them internally)."},{"type":"chat","description":"chat of scraping genius"},{"type":"chat","description":"show chat of giving the error messages over and over"},{"type":"chat","description":"snippet showing multiple artists. other mistakes: discrete sentiment vs. continuous, not cleaning bad lyrics"},{"type":"heading","value":"Part 3: Storyboard and prototyping"},{"type":"text","value":"Next, we asked Claude to create a storyboard – an outline of the story’s main points including ideas for charts and visuals."},{"type":"chat","description":"show its storyboard"},{"type":"text","value":"We asked it to prototype the visual ideas to make sure they worked with the real data. It wrote Python code to generate the charts which we ran by copy and pasting into Google Collab."},{"type":"heading","value":"Part 4: Production (development and writing)"},{"type":"text","value":"We asked Claude to transform the outline into a fully fleshed out draft. For the visuals, we moved into The Pudding’s development environment, Svelte, and asked it to structure the codebase, deciding which components to make and how they were nested."},{"type":"chat","description":"show component structure"},{"type":"text","value":"We gave it some of the predefined standards in our codebase (e.g., font stack), then we asked it to write the entirety of each component, making the charts that it had described and prototyped."},{"type":"chat","description":"show svelte component"},{"type":"text","value":"It described two images for us to generate, but since that is not a feature of Claude, we outsourced the work to…ChatGPT. The hero image/art was meant to be an illustration, but the final image was supposed to be more of a chart. Despite its thorough description, ChatGPT ended up creating more of an abstract art piece than a functional chart."},{"type":"heading","value":"Conclusions"},{"type":"text","value":"So the answer is: no, we do not feel threatened by this. When we look at what Claude produced, we don’t think it looks anything like a real Pudding piece. But would a casual reader notice the difference? We hope so, but that might be overly optimistic."},{"type":"text","value":"It’s sort of like comparing a woodworking artisan’s table to one from IKEA. The artisans invest immense time and effort into their high-quality pieces, IKEA produces things quickly and cheaply, and most people probably can’t tell the difference (or don’t care). Which is kind of sad for us artisans. With AI, we can expect a rise in superficially appealing but low-quality content. But that doesn’t mean there’s no place for craftsmanship. We still find meaning in the bespoke, at doing all the little things right, and in creating things that feel like they have a real person at the other end of it. And we can only hope that others do too."},{"type":"text","value":"We probably won’t be using Claude to write more articles, but we’ll certainly be using it and other AI tools as part of our toolkit. As Ezra Klein pointed out in a recent <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-adam-moss.html target=_blank>episode</a>, we see ourselves more as editors of the small tasks we outsource to AI. We know what the output should look like, and how to adjust things as needed. Here are a few examples of ways we already use AI to assist us:"},{"type":"list","value":["Writing a helper script to process images","Generating a handful of options for a headline","Asking Claude to be an idea sparring partner","Identifying names in text documents","Getting out of a Git jam"]}]}
