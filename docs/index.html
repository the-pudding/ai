How scared should we be that someone else could replicate what we do without the time, training, and expertise we have?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Basically, <strong>can AI write a Pudding piece?</strong> (Also, for those less well-versed with AI, what does it actually “do,” and how well does it do it?)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->So, we tried replacing ourselves! Before we started, we created a set of rules and guidelines for our interactions with the AI:<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><ul class="svelte-108tsdr"><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We broke the process of creating a Pudding piece down into four steps, and guided the AI through them. These were: idea generation, data collection & analysis, storyboarding & prototyping, and development & writing.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For each task, we prompted it until it either completed the task or failed repeatedly, at which point, we modified the task to make it surmountable.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Other than guiding it through the process and re-scoping when necessary, we attempted to intervene as little as possible.

For Claude, that meant scraping lyrics from Billboard top 100 hits from Genius.com. We asked it to write Python scripts which we ran for it (since it’s not able to run them internally).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><div class="chat svelte-8xkafd"><div>chat of scraping genius</div> </div><div class="chat svelte-8xkafd"><div>show chat of giving the error messages over and over</div> </div><div class="chat svelte-8xkafd"><div>snippet showing multiple artists. other mistakes: discrete sentiment vs. continuous, not cleaning bad lyrics</div> </div><h3 class="svelte-108tsdr"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Part 3: Storyboard and prototyping<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Next, we asked Claude to create a storyboard – an outline of the story’s main points including ideas for charts and visuals.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><div class="chat svelte-8xkafd"><div>show its storyboard</div> </div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We asked it to prototype the visual ideas to make sure they worked with the real data. It wrote Python code to generate the charts which we ran by copy and pasting into Google Collab.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><h3 class="svelte-108tsdr"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Part 4: Production (development and writing)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We asked Claude to transform the outline into a fully fleshed out draft. For the visuals, we moved into The Pudding’s development environment, Svelte, and asked it to structure the codebase, deciding which components to make and how they were nested.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><div class="chat svelte-8xkafd"><div>show component structure</div> </div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We gave it some of the predefined standards in our codebase (e.g., font stack), then we asked it to write the entirety of each component, making the charts that it had described and prototyped.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><div class="chat svelte-8xkafd"><div>show svelte component</div> </div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It described two images for us to generate, but since that is not a feature of Claude, we outsourced the work to…ChatGPT. The hero image/art was meant to be an illustration, but the final image was supposed to be more of a chart. Despite its thorough description, ChatGPT ended up creating more of an abstract art piece than a functional chart.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><h3 class="svelte-108tsdr"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Conclusions<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->So the answer is: no, we do not feel threatened by this. When we look at what Claude produced, we don’t think it looks anything like a real Pudding piece. But would a casual reader notice the difference? We hope so, but that might be overly optimistic.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It’s sort of like comparing a woodworking artisan’s table to one from IKEA. The artisans invest immense time and effort into their high-quality pieces, IKEA produces things quickly and cheaply, and most people probably can’t tell the difference (or don’t care). Which is kind of sad for us artisans. With AI, we can expect a rise in superficially appealing but low-quality content. But that doesn’t mean there’s no place for craftsmanship. We still find meaning in the bespoke, at doing all the little things right, and in creating things that feel like they have a real person at the other end of it. And we can only hope that others do too.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We probably won’t be using Claude to write more articles, but we’ll certainly be using it and other AI tools as part of our toolkit. As Ezra Klein pointed out in a recent <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-adam-moss.html target=_blank>episode</a>, we see ourselves more as editors of the small tasks we outsource to AI. We know what the output should look like, and how to adjust things as needed. Here are a few examples of ways we already use AI to assist us:<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><ul class="svelte-108tsdr"><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Writing a helper script to process images<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Generating a handful of options for a headline<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Asking Claude to be an idea sparring partner<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Identifying names in text documents<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li><li><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Getting out of a Git jam<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></li> </ul> <div class="svelte-127fg58" style="top: 0px;" data-svelte-h="svelte-120h8jo"><video src="assets/video/test.mp4" controls class="svelte-127fg58"></video> </div></article> </div> <div id="product" class="svelte-vrgwpu"><article class="svelte-vrgwpu"><header class="svelte-16t128f"><div class="logo-container svelte-16t128f"><a href="https://pudding.cool" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></div> <img src="assets/cover-art.jpg" alt="Cover art juxtaposing positive and negative imagery in hit songs" class="cover-art svelte-16t128f"> <h1 class="svelte-16t128f" data-svelte-h="svelte-5tyn4s">The Sadness of Song: How Pop Music is Turning to the Dark Side</h1> <p class="subtitle svelte-16t128f" data-svelte-h="svelte-geevic">An analysis of the emotional landscape of popular music over the last 60
		years</p> <div class="byline svelte-16t128f" data-svelte-h="svelte-99phsk">By <a href="https://pudding.cool/author/claude" target="_blank">Claude 3</a></div> </header> <section class="introduction svelte-pzzhhg" data-svelte-h="svelte-nh90ve"><p class="intro-text svelte-pzzhhg">In 2017, Julia Michaels&#39; hit song &quot;Issues&quot; took the pop world by storm. With
		lyrics like:</p> <blockquote>&quot;I&#39;m jealous, I&#39;m overzealous / When I&#39;m down, I get real down,&quot;</blockquote> <p>it laid bare the singer&#39;s emotional struggles over a catchy, upbeat melody.
		The song marked a striking shift in popular music: a mainstream embrace of
		darker, more negative themes.</p> <p class="intro-text svelte-pzzhhg">As it turns out, &quot;Issues&quot; was not an anomaly, but rather a sign of the
		times. Over the past decade, there has been a steady rise in the proportion
		of emotionally negative songs topping the Billboard charts, reflecting a
		broader shift in popular music&#39;s emotional landscape. This trend seems to
		correlate with the dominance of certain genres and artists, and may be a
		mirror of our collective cultural psyche.</p> <p class="intro-text svelte-pzzhhg">To understand this phenomenon, we analyzed the sentiment of every song that
		reached the Billboard Hot 100&#39;s top 10 from 1960 to 2020. Using advanced
		language processing, we assigned each song scores for eight basic emotions:
		anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. The
		results paint a fascinating picture of the evolving emotional tone of
		popular music.</p> </section> <section class="svelte-vrgwpu"><h2 class="svelte-vrgwpu" data-svelte-h="svelte-53wktd">The Rise of Negativity</h2> <div class="chart-container svelte-q7472g"> </div> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-h4ggtc">Our analysis reveals a clear upward trend in the percentage of songs
				with a predominantly negative emotional sentiment, particularly since
				the mid-2010s. In 2020, for the first time in the history of our
				dataset, negative songs outnumbered positive ones in the year-end top
				10.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-cf6c50">This rise in negativity is not attributable to any single emotion, but
				rather a confluence of increases in sadness, fear, disgust, and anger.
				Joy, while still the most common individual emotion, has been on a
				relative decline.</p> <div class="chart-container svelte-1qtg1r" id="emotions-small-multiples"> </div> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yht604">Interestingly, this shift coincides with the rise of Hip hop/Rap as the
				dominant genre in popular music, overtaking the more traditionally
				upbeat Pop. Hip hop songs, on average, tend to have a much higher
				proportion of negative emotions compared to other genres.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1u5qzk0">But this is not to say that negativity is confined to Hip hop. Across
				the board, from Pop to Rock to R&amp;B, songs with darker themes have been
				on the ascent. It seems to be a cross-genre zeitgeist, a pervasive mood
				in the music of our times.</p></section> <section class="svelte-vrgwpu"><h2 class="svelte-vrgwpu" data-svelte-h="svelte-yedn0x">The Artist Landscape</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ojuycu">Of course, behind every song is an artist, and each artist has their own
				distinctive emotional style or &quot;fingerprint.&quot; Some, like Billie Eilish
				or Juice WRLD, are known for their consistently dark and moody lyrics,
				while others, like Ariana Grande or BTS, tend towards a more positive,
				uplifting tone.</p> <div class="chart-container svelte-1d45vpu"><svg id="chart" width="0" height="600"><title>Artist Sentiment Scores</title></svg>  </div> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-19llaoe">Explore the scatterplot above to see where your favorite artists fall on
				the spectrum of musical emotion. You can search for specific artists,
				filter by genre and decade, and dive into any artist&#39;s full emotional
				profile.</p> <div class="chart-container svelte-1tfds4d" data-svelte-h="svelte-jxewvh"><svg class="radar-chart"><title>Artist Emotion Comparison</title></svg> </div> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1o8q7uw">What&#39;s fascinating is how an artist&#39;s emotional fingerprint can evolve
				over their career, often reflecting their personal growth and struggles.
				Taylor Swift, for example, started out with mostly positive, lovestruck
				anthems, but has increasingly explored darker, more introspective themes
				in her recent work.</p></section> <section class="svelte-vrgwpu"><h2 class="svelte-vrgwpu" data-svelte-h="svelte-grw4hp">Conclusion</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-uex27x">So what does this all mean? Why is popular music getting sadder? There are no
	easy answers, but a few potential factors come to mind.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-glup5x">On a socio-cultural level, the rise of social media has made it more
	acceptable and even encouraged to publicly express negative emotions. Global
	events like the pandemic, political upheavals, and the climate crisis have
	also undoubtedly affected our collective mood.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-119zk8h">There may also be a certain catharsis or relatability in hearing our own
	struggles echoed in the music we listen to. In an age of curated perfection on
	Instagram, there&#39;s a raw authenticity to an artist baring their emotional
	vulnerabilities.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-t10t68">It&#39;s worth noting that music has always been a reflection of its time. The
	protest songs of the 60s, the nihilistic punk of the 70s, the angsty grunge of
	the 90s - each era has its own emotional tone. Perhaps we are in the age of
	sad bangers, where melancholy and catchiness are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-14phkdh">Will this trend towards negativity continue? It&#39;s hard to say. Music is
	cyclical, and perhaps a brighter, more optimistic phase is around the corner.
	Or maybe we are entering a new normal, where sadness is the default mode of
	popular song.</p> <div class="emotional-journey-image svelte-1lv1wdy" data-svelte-h="svelte-fg10lq"><img src="assets/emotional-journey-image.jpg" alt="A winding path represents the emotional journey of popular music from the 1960s to the present. The path is divided into sections, each marked with distinctive styles and colors to indicate the predominant emotions of that era. The colors transition from bright and cheerful hues in the earlier decades to darker and more somber tones in recent years. Iconic symbols and silhouettes along the path represent significant milestones, genres, and artists. Small charts and graphs illustrate the changing proportions of emotions over time. The background complements the emotional journey with abstract shapes, textures, and patterns that evoke the mood of each era. A legend explains the significance of the colors, symbols, and charts used." class="svelte-1lv1wdy"> <p class="image-caption svelte-1lv1wdy">The Emotional Evolution of Popular Music</p></div> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1q4o23v">Regardless, one thing is clear: music has the profound power to reflect and
	shape our emotions. The songs we listen to are not just background noise; they
	are a mirror of our times, a shared emotional language. As we navigate an
	increasingly complex and challenging world, maybe a little musical melancholy
	is just what we need to feel less alone. After all, in the words of another
	recent hit, &quot;Everybody hurts sometimes.&quot;

	to 2020. The lyrics for each song were sourced from the Genius API.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ysp56e">To determine the emotional content of each song, we used the NRC Sentiment and
	Emotion Lexicons. These lexicons contain a list of English words and their
	associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust,
	surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and
	positive).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fa7cuk">Each song&#39;s lyrics were analyzed and assigned a score for each of the eight
	emotions based on the frequency and intensity of emotion-related words. The
	primary sentiment (positive or negative) was determined by which sentiment had
	the higher score.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-183pkqc">It&#39;s important to note that this is an automated analysis based on word
	associations, and may not always capture the full nuance and context of a
	song&#39;s emotional content. Sarcasm, for example, or complex storytelling may be
	misinterpreted. However, across a large dataset, it provides a robust overall
	picture of the patterns and trends in the emotional landscape of popular
	music.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-re1v80">You can explore the full datasets and code used in this analysis on our
